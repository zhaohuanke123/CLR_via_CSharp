One of the reasons why this statement is true is that a lot of applications exploit bugs, either knowingly or unknowingly. If a later version of a file fixes a bug, the application no longer runs as expected

> > If an assembly is to be accessed by multiple applications, the assembly must be placed into a wellknown directory, and the CLR must know to look in this directory automatically when a reference to the assembly is detected. This well-known location is called the global assembly cache (GAC). The exact location of the GAC is an implementation detail that is subject to change with different versions of the .NET Framework. However, you can typically find it in the following directory:
